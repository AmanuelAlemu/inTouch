inTouch
=======
MainActivity, UserProfile, and Group.java all go in the same directory: src/com/example/intouch.
Layout folder goes in /res.
divider.xml also goes in res. Put one copy in each of the 5 drawable folders

I commented the important bits of code, I hope it helps.

UserProfile and Group are classes I created. It's the structure that comes to mind when I think of them, but they could be changed if it doesn't work out. In android apps apparently a thing that happens a lot is linking class files with activity files. I haven't done that, but we'll see if we have to when the time comes I guess. 

Output is a screenshot of what it looks like on my phone when I run it. If only I could make a video of me scrolling through it instead of having to take a picture. Alas, Google is a cunt.
